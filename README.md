## Criteria A: Planning 

### Definition of Problem

Throughout the previous centuries, total giving – the amount of money that went to charitable purposes – accounted for around 2% of the GDP worldwide, and in 2017 it was a whopping $410.02 billion (“Giving Statistics”). Therefore, the demand for a tool to help people find charity organizations worldwide has risen. My client, an acquaintance, wants to be involved in the cause but finds it challenging to look for the right charity based on his preference.

### Proposed Solution

The web application utilizes the Global Giving organizations API to provide users with a list of global charities to find one that matches their philanthropic interests. It uses Javascript with frameworks such as React and Next.js as the scripting language, HTML as a markup language, and CSS with Sass and Tailwind CSS as a stylesheet language.

#### Javascript

First, Javascript is a high-level programming language with simple syntax – similar to that of Python. As a result, it’s easy to pick up for a Python programmer. Secondly, Javascript is the most popular programming language for web applications’ client-side behavior thanks to its abundance of third-party libraries (“Usage Statistics of JavaScript as Client-side Programming Language on Websites, August 2022”).

#### React and Next.js

React is an open-source Javascript framework for creating interactive UI. First introduced by Facebook (Meta) in 2013, it became one of the most popular JS frameworks for website development. (“React – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces”)

Next.js is an open-source framework built with Node.js that adds functionalities such as server-side rendering, static websites, smart bundling, etc., for React-based websites (“Next.js by Vercel - The React Framework”).

#### CSS and Sass

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language that determines the styles – position, size, color, etc. – of the content represented by HTML or XML (“CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN”). 

Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass) is an extension of CSS that allows developers to use features such as variables, imports, etc. (“Sass Introduction”).

#### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is a CSS framework that lets developers use classes in the markup language (HTML) to apply CSS properties directly (“Tailwind CSS - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.”).

#### Global Giving API

The Global Giving organization developed an Application Programming Interface (API) – software for applications to communicate with each other – that shares information about charity movements worldwide.

#### MongoDB



### Success Criteria

1. User is able to Add and Remove data in the table
2. User is able to Edit existing data
3. The application has a login and register page
4. The login information and database are secured and the password is hashed
5. Function to sort the table based on different factors
6. Follow good coding practises, which allow for future extensions by other developers
