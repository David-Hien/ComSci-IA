## Criteria A: Planning 

### Definition of Problem

Throughout the previous centuries, total giving – the amount of money that went to charitable purposes – accounted for around 2% of the GDP worldwide, and in 2017 it was a whopping $410.02 billion<sup>[[1]](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=42)</sup>. Therefore, the demand for a tool to help people find charity organizations worldwide has risen. My client, an acquaintance, wants to be involved in the cause but finds it challenging to look for the right charity based on his preference.

### Proposed Solution

The web application utilizes the Global Giving organizations API to provide users with a list of global charities to find one that matches their philanthropic interests. It uses Javascript with frameworks such as React and Next.js as the scripting language, HTML as a markup language, and CSS with Sass and Tailwind CSS as a stylesheet language.

#### Javascript

First, Javascript is a high-level programming language with simple syntax – similar to that of Python. As a result, it’s easy to pick up for a Python programmer. Secondly, Javascript is the most popular programming language for web applications’ client-side behavior thanks to its abundance of third-party libraries<sup>[[2]](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-javascript/)</sup>.

#### React and Next.js

React is an open-source Javascript framework for creating interactive UI. First introduced by Facebook (Meta) in 2013, it became one of the most popular JS frameworks for website development<sup>[[3]](https://reactjs.org)</sup>. 

Next.js is an open-source framework built with Node.js that adds functionalities such as server-side rendering, static websites, smart bundling, etc., for React-based websites<sup>[[4]](https://nextjs.org)</sup>.

#### CSS and Sass

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language that determines the styles – position, size, color, etc. – of the content represented by HTML or XML<sup>[[5]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)</sup>. 

Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass) is an extension of CSS that allows developers to use features such as variables, imports, etc.<sup>[[6]](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/sass_intro.php)</sup>.

#### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is a CSS framework that lets developers use classes in the markup language (HTML) to apply CSS properties directly<sup>[[7]](https://tailwindcss.com)</sup>.

#### Global Giving API

The Global Giving organization developed an Application Programming Interface (API) – software for applications to communicate with each other – that shares information about charity movements worldwide.

#### MongoDB



### Success Criteria

1. Login system using email and password for securing user credentials.
2. Users can see a page heading containing the application name.
3. Search bar provides quick and easy access to a collection of charity organizations and their updates through Global Giving API.
4. Users can click the 'Search' button (or Enter) to display information cards for the matching organizations in a search results area.
5. Users can see organization information cards in the search results area containing name, title, and a short desciption:
6. The organization’s information card hyperlink opens a new tab on that organization’s home page.
7. Users can see a page footer with links to your social media accounts, including social media icons (like the Twitter icon).
